# hello-world

Online courses I completed between 2016-2019 that I still had saved on my hard drive. Will be commiting any more that I find laying around.

For some background, I wanted to learn programming despite it not being offered as part of the Brazilian school curriculum. So, I decided to self-teach. Online courses were a huge part of this endeavor. However challenging they might've been back then, they are what made me fall in love with computer science and brought me to pursue an EECS degree, so I'm incredibly grateful to the people who spend time and money creating these courses and making them available online for free.
